# # Day 1 - 8 Months Bug Bounty Challenge

I Created This Challenge, locking myself up in the Room to do Bug Bounties. This is my Last Chance to do this, or my life will become a Whole Mess. One Chance => One Life 

**Wake Up** → 3:45 AM

I started working at 4:00 AM. I Wake Up Just Because, I was Dreaming About Finding Bugs. I just got up and  started working within minutes. From 4:00 AM till around 6:30 AM, I worked for 2 & Half hours without a Break To Look Out on Misconfigured Account Takeover in every Hackerone Program then took a Nap Till 9 AM. Then Worked for About Half an Hour

## ## Deep Work

1 Session - 10:30 am - 3:00 am - Worked With Pomodoro Technique ( 1 Hour 10 Mins Break)

## Verse -

What is meant for you will reach you, even if it is beneath two mountains. And what is not meant for you, will not reach you.
