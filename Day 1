# Day 19

🎯 We received 2 bounties today!  
🕵️‍♂️ Reported 1 bug as well. Spent the whole day hacking alongside Discord member **Two**.  
I tried to show the impact for a cookie-based XSS and am still working on finding a proper way to demonstrate it. On the bright side, I’m seeing progress in automation efforts and will continue pushing there.  

😴 Didn't do much in the afternoon since I was expecting a fresh invite at 11:30 PM.  

🏋️‍♂️ After my evening gym session from **6:15 PM to 7:30 PM**, I had my protein shake and took a nap until 11 PM. Woke up to hunt a private program. It wasn’t the most interesting target, but I managed to report **1 valid bug**.

## 💪 Gym Session

Today, I had the opportunity to work out with a fellow bug hunter who's just getting started and feeling a bit lost. We spent over an hour at the gym together. I answered all his questions and helped guide him a bit. We trained **chest** today.

## 🎬 Fun Part

I watched the movie **[Counterstrike](https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81936018?source=35)** on Netflix. Decent watch for the night!
