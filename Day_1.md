## Day 1

🚀 8 Months Bug Bounty Challenge Begins  
I’ve locked myself in a room to commit fully to bug bounty hunting.  
This is **my last chance** – *One Chance → One Life*.  
No distractions. Only progress.

😴 Woke up at 3:45 AM — literally dreaming about finding bugs.  
Started working at **4:00 AM** sharp.

👨‍💻 Morning Session (4:00 AM to 6:30 AM)  
Worked **2.5 hours** straight, focusing on **Misconfigured Account Takeover** across all HackerOne programs.  
Took a nap until **9:00 AM**, followed by a **30-minute session**.

🧠 Deep Work Sessions  
- Continued recon across private programs.  
- Documented scope for 2 programs.  
- Built automation for subdomain enumeration.

Watched an episode of *Mr. Robot* to stay sharp and motivated.
